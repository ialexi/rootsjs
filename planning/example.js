// an example Roots application API that will evolve as time goes on?
// first, rt-init Contacts generates:
/*
contacts/
	main.js	-- starts server
	core.js -- connects to apps with auto-app-loader (reload scripts automatically?)
	seeds/
		contacts/
			core.js -- defines sub-seeds
	client/ (normal sproutcore project)
		(normal sproutcore stuff here)
		frameworks/
			pomona/	-> handles all roots connectivity stuff
	build/ -- the build directory (includes a core.js that can be run at non-root levels)
	
the main.js and core.js are on a project level. Apps (or seeds) also have
core.js's.

The default core.js would look something like:
exports.seed = Roots.AutoSeed.extend({
	// AutoSeed constructor requires a path.
	// in essence, automatically creates "signal handlers" named for each seed.
});

main.js does require("core") and asks for "seed", which it creates with
.create(theFolderWithCoreInIt)

main.js adds the seed as a Thestral responding to a publicly-accessible
handler (such as the Firenze long-polling server with a Dudley receiver).
In this way, the seed can receive events, or signals, from the client.

main.js also starts sc-server, and possibly eventually has sc-server as
a JavaScript-based HTTP server component within itself.

// Resource is a specific thing which may be attached to. It is a subclass of Seed.
// Root is a Root Seedâ€”really used primarily as a reference point (so resources or seeds
// can call root() and such).
// Seed is the basic unit.

// if you have a SC model set up, here's what you should need to do:
Root.extend({
	// requiresAuth simply checks if the user _is_ authenticated.
	// for more, you'd have to use permission-stuff, which takes more code.
	// the default way, though, is still super-easy: permissionSet: "contact"
	// it is when you need more control that things get interesting.
	
	// attachments do the "right thing" when it comes to auth; they won't connect the
	// user until they have been verified, but they queue the request and check for
	// authention. Basically, they check iq.authenticated, and if it is false, they
	// send the "authenticated" signal to check; they will get back either a yes or now,
	// and process the queue appropriately. If the user authenticates within a certain time
	// period (the timeout of the queue), the attachments will be made and initial data sent.
	
	// all perfectly async.
