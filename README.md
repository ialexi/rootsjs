If you want to watch me develop Dobby and Roots on node.js, this is the place.
But I really mean watch. I have _nothing_ working yet.

THIS CODE IS ONLINE MERELY SO I CAN SHARE IT BETWEEN MY 2 COMPUTERS!!!


Some miscellaneous notes:
I think the server infrastructure for Comet will be Dobby. Dobby will not be
SproutCore specific, but will be a _part_ of Roots, which _will_ be SproutCore
specific.

Just a thought. I have to actually make Dobby/Roots in node.js first.
